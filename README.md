play-test helps inspectors track and document safety checks on inflatable play equipment. It handles equipment records, inspection forms, photo management, and PDF report generation. Makes repeat inspections of the same units quick and straightforward.

A public instance is live at **[play-test.co.uk](https://play-test.co.uk)**.

## Getting Started

### Docker

Quickest way to try it out:

```bash
docker pull dockerstefn/play-test
docker run -p 3000:3000 dockerstefn/play-test
```

### Development Setup

There's a Nix flake for easy environment setup:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/play-test.git
cd play-test

# With direnv (recommended)
direnv allow

# Or manually with Nix
nix develop

# Standard Rails setup
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails server
```

### Traditional Setup

```bash
# Requires Ruby 3.0+ and SQLite
bundle install
rails db:setup
rails server
```

## Testing

Currently over 90% test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
bin/test

# Check specific file coverage
bin/coverage_check app/models/inspection.rb

# View detailed HTML report
open coverage/index.html
```

## Test Coverage

If you want to help improve Play-Test, a great way would be to write some more `rspec` and `Capybara` tests. Check out [coverage.play-test.co.uk](https://coverage.play-test.co.uk/) for an up-to-date test coverage breakdown.

## Tech Stack

- **Rails 8.0+** - With minimal gems
- **SQLite** - No fancy databases (yet?)
- **RSpec & Capybara** - 90%+ test coverage
- **Semantic HTML + MVP.css** - Simple CSS
- **Turbo** for progressive JS enhancement
