# Chobble App Gem Migration Summary

This document summarizes the extraction of reusable components into the `chobble-app` gem.

## What Was Moved to the Gem

### Models

- `UsersController` - User management
- `PagesController` - CMS page management
- `SearchController` - Search functionality

### Helpers
- `ApplicationHelper` - Common view helpers
- `SessionsHelper` - Authentication helpers
- `UsersHelper` - User-related helpers
- `PagesHelper` - Page helpers

### Views
- All session views (login/logout)
- All user views (index, show, edit, etc.)
- All page views (CMS)
- Search views
- Layouts
- PWA views
- Shared partials (generic ones like `_action_buttons`, `_header_logo`, etc.)

### Assets
- Core stylesheets (application.css, base/, buttons.css, themes, etc.)
- Core JavaScript files (application.js, search.js, etc.)
- Generic images (logo.svg, favicon.svg, etc.)

### Library Files

- `search.en.yml`

## What Stayed in the Main App

### Models
- All inspection-related models
- All assessment models

- `Unit`

### Controllers
- All inspection controllers
- All assessment controllers
- `InspectorCompaniesController`
- `UnitsController`
- `SafetyStandardsController`
- `GuidesController`

## How to Use the Gem

1. The gem is referenced in the Gemfile as a local path gem
2. App models inherit from gem models (e.g., `User < ChobbleApp::User`)
3. App controllers inherit from gem controllers
4. App helpers include gem helpers
5. Routes are defined in the main app (not in the gem)
6. App-specific behavior is added through:
   - Method overrides
   - Hook methods (e.g., `after_login_path`, `load_app_specific_data`)
   - Additional associations and validations

## Benefits

- Core infrastructure is now reusable across different Chobble apps
- Inspection-specific code is cleanly separated
- Main app can focus on domain-specific functionality
- Updates to core functionality can be made in one place
- Easy to create new Chobble apps with the same infrastructure

## Next Steps for New Apps

To create a new Chobble app using this gem:

1. Create a new Rails app
2. Add the gem to the Gemfile
3. Create models that inherit from the gem's models
4. Create controllers that inherit from the gem's controllers
5. Include the gem's helpers
6. Define app-specific routes
7. Add domain-specific models, controllers, and views
8. Override any gem behavior as needed through inheritance
